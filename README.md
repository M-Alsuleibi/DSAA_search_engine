# Basic Search Engine Application

## About the Project

### Introduction
In the rapidly evolving world of technology, efficiently managing and retrieving information is essential. Search engines play a critical role in this process by enabling users to locate, access, and utilize data from vast repositories. This project focuses on developing a basic search engine application, providing an opportunity to apply key programming concepts to solve real-world problems.

### Purpose of the Project
The primary purpose of this project is to build a basic search engine that allows users to search through a dataset, locate files, and organize data. The program integrates key features such as data retrieval, sorting algorithms, and a user-friendly menu interface. Additionally, the project emphasizes data persistence through serialization to maintain user data and application state across sessions.

Through this project, you will gain practical experience in:
- Reading and parsing data from files.
- Implementing sorting algorithms.
- Designing intuitive user interfaces.
- Managing user interactions.
- Ensuring data persistence through serialization and deserialization.

This project integrates the programming concepts youâ€™ve learned in this course, as well as previous ones, into a cohesive and functional application.

## Goals of the Project
By the end of this project, you will have created a fully functional search engine with the following capabilities:

1. **Data Retrieval**: Read and parse data from files, populate a data structure, and create objects representing the data.
2. **Sorting**: Implement sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort) to organize the data based on user-defined criteria.
3. **User Interaction**: Design a text-based menu system for searching, viewing, and sorting data.
4. **User Activity Logging**: Log and save user interactions for debugging and future analysis.
5. **Data Persistence**: Serialize and deserialize data to ensure the application's state is maintained between sessions.
